        <h3>Christmas Breakfast Sausage Casserole</h3>
        <p>My mom has always made this cheesy sausage casserole for us on Christmas morning, and we look forward to eating it every year. It is so delicious, and everyone enjoys it! You can use croutons instead of making toast, and sage sausage for a different flavor.</p>
